    %h3 The Goal

    %p
      My goal is to become a world-class web developer in one
      year and to share my progress and discoveries along the
      way.
    %p
      I feel that the difference between competence and greatness
      is purpose, focus, and vulnerability. From August 2012
      through August 2013 I plan to apply myself &mdash; publicly
      &mdash; to documenting this journey.
    %p
      Teaching is true learning. To cement my knowledge and
      increase my urgency I plan to organize what I learn and
      give talks at user groups and conferences. Getting feedback
      will be important both to break out of habits and to improve
      my communication.

    %h3 The Plan
    %p
      Every two weeks I will begin a new subject and choose a
      concrete project to practice it. As I complete the projects
      I will present them in talks and blog posts. This provides
      an opportunity to evaluate the result.
    %p
      I am free Fridays all day to work with other developers and
      learn from them. I would especially love to spend the day
      at other software development shops to absorb their
      perspectives and share my knowledge.

    %h3 The Movement
    %p
      What started as my own method for self improvement is becoming
      a movement.  Start your own 1up challenge and get serious
      about your dreams.
